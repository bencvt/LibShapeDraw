Installation instructions for ${libshapedraw.name} v${libshapedraw.version} [${minecraft.version}]:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, make sure that either ModLoader or Forge is installed.
LibShapeDraw is compatible with either. Then do one of the following, whichever
you prefer:

 *  Use a launcher utility to add the jar (recommended). There are many
    launchers out there, e.g. Magic Launcher.

OR

 *  Move the jar file to the `coremods` subdirectory. This subdirectory can be
    be found in your Minecraft directory. If you use ModLoader rather than
    Forge, use the `mods` subdirectory instead.

OR

 *  Manually patch the contents of the jar file into your `minecraft.jar`.
    Old-school modding still works. Be sure to remove the `META-INF` folder.
